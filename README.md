# Hi, I'm Oluwatobi Mustapha 


**Specializing in Multi-Cloud IAM, Non-Human Identity, and Policy-as-Code.**

> I architect **Cloud Identity** as the **primary security perimeter**. I move beyond basic permissions to build centralized IAM fabrics across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, enforcing strict **Least Privilege** for every human and machine principal.

---

## Key Projects

* **IAM Logic Fuzzer :** Built a tool to catch logic flaws and hidden permission conflicts that standard audits miss. It automatically validates security posture against the **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**.

* **Cedar Compliance Guardrails :** Implemented Policy-as-Code rules that act as an unchangeable safety net. This prevents **Configuration Drift** and ensures security settings cannot be accidentally broken by developers.

* **Automated Access Vending :** Created a self-service system for granting permissions. This eliminates manual approval bottlenecks and automatically generates the exact evidence needed for **SOC2 (Logical Access)** audits.

* **Shadow Admin Scanner :** Designed a risk detection engine to find hidden *Super User"* paths. It translates complex technical risks directly into **NIST 800-53** compliance reports for leadership.

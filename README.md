## 🧠 Highlight Projects

- **AWS Cloud Incident Response Lab** – Simulated a full-scale cloud attack lifecycle (Exfiltration, Privilege Escalation, CloudTrail Investigation, Anti-Forensics). Documented every phase and automated evidence collection.  
- **AWS Cloud SOC Monitoring: Attack Detection & Response** – Built detection rules using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and EventBridge to alert and respond to malicious IAM and S3 activity.  
- **AWS IAM Key Abuse Detection** – Simulated compromised IAM keys and tested AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantineV3 policy response and detection speed.  
- **Honeypot Deployment on AWS** – Deployed a monitored honeypot using EC2, VPC flow logs, and GuardDuty to observe attacker behavior and collect intelligence.  
- **Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark** – Captured, inspected, and triaged live network traffic to identify patterns of reconnaissance and command-and-control activity.  
- **Threat Detection with Wireshark** – Detected anomalies in packet captures and correlated them with attacker behaviors seen in AWS GuardDuty findings.  
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Simulation** – Deployed Windows and Linux systems, simulated malware infections, and analyzed response workflows.  
- **Incident Response (On-Prem)** – Practiced structured evidence collection, triage, and containment across hybrid environments.

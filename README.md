# Hi, I'm Oluwatobi Mustapha 👋

### Cloud Security Engineer | Identity & Infrastructure Security

**Specializing in Identity-Native Infrastructure, Multi-Cloud Governance, and Policy-as-Code.**

I engineer security solutions that bridge the gap between DevOps velocity and rigid compliance. My work focuses on architecting Zero Trust identity fabrics and automating privilege management across AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes environments. I move beyond standard "click-ops" administration to build scalable, code-driven security mechanisms.

## 🚀 Active Development & Research

I am currently engineering solutions for **Non-Human Identity (NHI)** and **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)**, addressing the security challenges of modern, ephemeral infrastructure.

- **Automated CIEM & Privilege Analysis:** Developing Python-based tooling to detect "Shadow Admins" and visualize hidden privilege escalation paths within AWS IAM.
- **Workload Identity Federation:** Architecting "keyless" authentication patterns using OIDC to eliminate long-lived credentials in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions $\leftrightarrow$ AWS/Azure/GCP).
- **Generative AI for Governance:** Researching the integration of LLMs to audit complex JSON policies and automate least-privilege generation.
